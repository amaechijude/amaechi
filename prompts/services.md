4. **Pricing/Timeline** (practical considerations)
5. **CTAs** (clear next steps)

**Generate a Services section that transforms vague "what you do" into concrete, purchasable offerings that make it incredibly easy for both businesses and aspiring developers to understand how to work with you. The section should feel professional and trustworthy while maintaining the premium dark aesthetic and smooth user experience, ultimately converting portfolio visitors into paying clients and mentees.
