**Create a compelling "Experience & Impact" section that seamlessly weaves together professional career progression with web development mentoring achievements, positioning you as both a technical expert and knowledge catalyst:**

### Layout & Structure
- **Container**: Full-width section with max-width 1200px, generous vertical padding (120px top/bottom desktop, 80px mobile)
- **Section Header**: "Experience & Impact" with subtitle "Building software and empowering developers"
- **Dual Timeline Layout**: Professional experience (left track) interwoven with mentorship milestones (right track)
- **Visual Connection**: Central timeline spine connecting professional and mentoring achievements chronologically
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Single column with alternating professional/mentoring blocks

### Professional Timeline Design (Left Track)
- **Company Cards**: Each role as a distinct card with company logo, title, duration
- **Achievement Focus**: 2-3 bullet points per role emphasizing impact over responsibilities
- **Metrics Integration**: Quantifiable results (performance improvements, team growth, revenue impact)
- **Technology Context**: Key technologies used, architectural decisions made
- **Visual Treatment**: `#1e293b` background cards with subtle borders and hover elevation

### Mentorship Timeline Design (Right Track)
- **Milestone Markers**: Key mentoring achievements as distinct visual elements
- **Impact Metrics**: Students helped, career transitions enabled, success rates
- **Teaching Evolution**: How your mentoring approach has developed over time
- **Success Stories**: Brief, anonymized testimonials or achievement highlights
- **Community Involvement**: Workshops, content creation, speaking engagements

### Visual Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Continue `#0f172a` background, `#1e293b` for timeline cards, `#8b5cf6` for timeline spine and accents

### Animation Strategy
- **Timeline Reveal**: Spine animates from top to bottom, then cards fade in sequentially
- **Scroll-Triggered**: Each timeline section animates when 30% visible
- **Card Entrance**: Alternating from left (professional) and right (mentoring) with slight slide motion
- **Hover Interactions**: Card elevation, subtle glow effects, company logo color enhancement
- **Timing**: 200ms delays between timeline items, smooth easing curves

### Visual Hierarchy Priorities
1. **Current/Recent Role** (most prominent professional achievement)

3. **Career Progression** (timeline of growth and increasing responsibility)
4. **Teaching Philosophy** (what drives your mentoring approach)
5. **Historical Context** (earlier roles and mentoring beginnings)

**Generate an Experience & Impact section that uniquely positions you as a senior developer who not only builds exceptional software but also builds exceptional developers. The section should demonstrate how mentoring has made you a better technical leader while showing the tangible impact you've had on both codebases and careers. Maintain the premium dark aesthetic while creating a narrative that differentiates you from typical senior developer portfolios.**
